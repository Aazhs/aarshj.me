          I love making homemade pasta — it's a simple joy that combines technique and creativity. Fresh pasta is soft and silky, and when tossed with a light sauce it lets the ingredients sing.

          This recipe comes from experimenting with different flours and resting times. The key is not to overwork the dough; let it rest so the gluten relaxes and rolling becomes effortless.
        </p>

        <p>
          Serve your pasta with seasonal produce — a drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkle of parmesan, and fresh basil can make a humble bowl feel special. Bon appétit!

          Git is an essential tool for every developer. It allows you to track changes, collaborate with teammates, and maintain a complete history of your project. Understanding branching and merging is key to working effectively in teams.

        <p>
          Learn to write meaningful commit messages and use branching strategies like Git Flow or GitHub Flow. These practices help organize your workflow and make it easier for others to understand your project's evolution.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether you're working solo or in a large team, mastering Git will save you from countless headaches and make you a more confident developer. Practice regularly and explore advanced features like rebasing and stashing.

        <h3 class="title">The Importance of Clean Code and Best Practices</h3>
        <h4 class="author"><img src="assets/user-icon.svg" alt="author" class="icon"> Aarsh Joshi</h4>

          Writing clean code isn't just about making your code look pretty — it's about making your code maintainable and scalable for your team and your future self. Clear variable names and consistent formatting save hours of debugging.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following design patterns and SOLID principles helps you avoid technical debt. Refactoring regularly and writing tests ensure your codebase remains healthy and adaptable to change.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remember, code is read far more often than it is written. By prioritizing clarity and simplicity, you're investing in the long-term success of your projects and the productivity of your team.
